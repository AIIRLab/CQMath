1776005	3624974	are you trying to proceed without using the fact I mentioned in the last sentence, or did you want a proof of that fact? I think your problem is not much less general than the fact as I gave it, so proving the general case ($\epsilon_i$ not restricted to be linear) might be unavoidable.	2	Combination
1653396	3372759	Um... so you're asking if you can leave _the notation for the thing you're defining_ out of the definition? Then it seems that no useful definition is left.	2	Combination
60136	139202	Complex or real?  If complex, you need $(x^*Ay)(y^*Ax)$ on the left.	3	Combination
2190671	4506878	I guess this is part of the proof of Theorem 6 in Chapter 3.4 of the PDE book by L. C. Evans. Am I right? In that case, the integral for q goes from $x$ to $+\infty$.	3	Combination
4341373	9056226	@DonThousand Are you reading $\exists!$ as "there's no"? I think it's usually read as "there's exactly one" (or possibly "there's at most one" in some sources).	3	Combination
1835294	3752997	The convenience is assuming they are disjoint, so that you don't have to go through the process of formally making them disjoint, which may just make notation in the proof messier if carried out. I am not really sure what you have a problem with anymore: you know what disjoint union is, you know about free product of disjoint sets, so what is your problem with that making the groups disjoint? $G*G$ is just a name for a group which is the free product of disjoint copies of $G$ (which you should know how to do if you know the disjoint union of sets)	3	Combination
1282964	2604898	Is $k$ an unknown constant between selections, or a uniformly distributed random variable realised on each trial?	3	Combination
1462223	2977842	Well why didn't you write that, then, if that's what you want to do? You didn't even mention parity. Please edit the question so that it can be undertstood without having to read the comments. Also, I don't see what in that description corresponds to your $\lt$ relations.	3	Combination
2119652	4359305	Now, prove that $Im (f)=U_\infty$. Do you need any help with it?	3	Combination
1795060	3664841	It's "prove" not "proove" and "number" is ambiguous (natural? rational? real? complex? ordinal?).	3	Combination
3118852	6425756	Why are you concluding with "thus $ab = 0$? That's unnecessary. We already assumed that, and it's not what we're after. And don't use $a^{-1}$ until you have assumed that $a\neq 0$.	2	Combination
1796754	3668557	How do you deduce $\frac{f(2k)}{2} \geq \frac{f(a_1)+f(a_2)}{4}$? You have $a_1+a_2=2k$, so $f(2k)=f(a_1+a_2) \leq f(a_1)+f(a_2)$...	2	Combination
2697552	5569905	The dirac delta function is a distribution, and thus takes a function for it's input. I am not sure what you are doing here. Also, how do you obtain $f^{-1}(u)=x^\prime -x$? Are you assuming that $f$ is linear?	2	Combination
2752458	5678343	If the tests have different weight then wouldn't your teacher adjust the denominator accordingly? e.g, if you got 29 out of 35 points on Test 2 but 22 out of 22 on Test 4, then dropping Test 2 would lower your denominator by 35 points whereas dropping Test 4 would lower your denominator by only 22.	2	Combination
3612783	7426161	Do you mean $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$? And what is gf(2)?	1	Combination
1414359	2881746	Linear as in admitting a faithful finite-dimensional representation? Well, what do you thiink about the problem?	1	Combination
3970620	8190947	What have you tried? Hint: the system doesn't necessarily have a unique solution.	1	Combination
814488	1683178	I think that's a little too broad? Squares can have so many interpretations. When it's in a formula (e.g. $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$), I just tend to interpret it as: "A 'small' variation in $v$ will cause a 'big' variation in $E_k$", or "if my velocity keeps getting higher, my kinetic energy will also keep getting higher, but at a much higher rate".	1	Combination
4369999	9130927	Which programming language is that? I'm guessing TypeScript.	1	Combination
2775471	5723980	What have you done on this?  Can you compute the probability of success if you flip the coin 5 times, say?	1	Combination
2302679	4737563	Of what are you taking the product in the second and third lines? Should it be $\mathcal{F}(U_i\cap U_j)$? Also, writing  $$\sigma(s_1,s_2)=(s_1,s_1|_{U_2},s_2|_{U_1},s_2)\qquad\text{ and }\qquad\sigma'(s_1,s_2)=(s_1,s_2|_{U_1},s_1|_{U_2},s_2),$$ assumes an ordering on the product over $I^2$. If you don't assume an arbitrary ordering on the products then it is clear that the maps $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are in fact the same.	1	Combination
3333495	6860033	What's the role of $x_i$? Position?	1	Combination
1857145	3802128	Have you looked at the proof? What is it proving?	1	Combination
1807382	3692715	Can you expand the polynomial and compute the coefficient of $x$ in $f(x)$?  What is the value of $f$ when $x=p$?	1	Combination
1020390	2082051	Do you integrate from $a$ to $b$ and do you average the integral by dividing by $b-a$? Also should you have $f(x) \geq 0$?	1	Combination
4029990	8322275	What if $F = 0$? You will need more conditions than only continuity. And what do you mean with *"a linear system cannot be driven to the origin with nice controls"*? Linear state feedback is not nice? Why?	1	Combination
237142	525087	Yes, you can. Do you need to give such a number? Do you know about continued fractions?	1	Combination
116332	270457	I know the theory behind it, I'm just not sure how I'd attempt to do it.  You know why it takes a minimum of n-1 comparisons to find the smallest element, right?  Well, without giving it away, once you know the smallest, how would you develop a short list of candidates for the runner up?	0	Combination
2377952	4902241	But what is the proposition you're trying to prove? The Well-Ordering Principle?	0	Combination
4145975	8580799	Can $x^!$ be solved?  $\sqrt{{\rm True}}$?  $\sum\limits_{x=!}^{\sqrt{ +}}$?	0	Combination
1515662	3086828	What do you mean by curve?  If you just mean a continuous image of $[0,1]$, then a space-filling curve gives a counter-example.	0	Combination
817321	1689244	What is your definition of $x\times y$? Also, your relation with $\sin \alpha$ is wrong.	0	Combination
1626854	3317287	If your understanding of the question is correct and f(v,w) = v + w you just have to show f(v,w) + f(y, z) = f(v+y, w+z) and f(k(v,w)) = kf(v,w).  Actually your statment $(f + g)(s) = f(s) + g(s)$ doesn't seem right to me.  That's always true by definition, isn't it?  I think you meant f(s + t) = f(s) + f(t).  Unless I misunderstand what you meant...	0	Combination
1895452	3888257	Isn't $f(p)$ simply too large a number to be a factor of $p^n-1$ in most cases? Bernoulli's inequality implies that $f(p)\ge(p-1)^{n+1}>p^n-1$ when $p>n+1$. And that is not a tight estimate. Anyway, $p$ needs to be small, so if you rule out small cases, then it probably will work, but also may not be as interesting as the case $\deg f=n$.	0	Combination
2720906	5618105	You just need to check that the three axioms in the definition are satisfied. Which of the three is giving you problems? Did you try verifying the axioms for linear matroids? The notion of "flat" of a matroid is the combinatorial abstraction of a vector subspace, so verifying the axioms for linear matroids might be more natural. That verification is useful for the graphic case since every graphic matroid is linear.	0	Combination
1656210	3377881	Well it can't be uniform like that since the range of $Y/X$ is all of $\Bbb R$ isn't it?	0	Combination
4074964	8420105	It is $t$ or $p$ ? Is it $dt$ or $dx$ ? Also I don't think integrating on $\mathbb R^-$ is relevant, $x^{2-t}$ is not defined there for most of the reals $t$ ? (only on $\mathbb Q_{odd}$ the rationals with odd denominator).	0	Combination
2479425	5122755	Is the answer 53??	2	Confirmation
2896068	5983599	Do you mean: "post the shortcut as answer"?	3	Confirmation
1886956	3870163	So, you have a list of triangles but some of them might be degenerate, and you run into trouble when you try to build a local coordinate system on one of these bad triangles. Is that a fair assessment of the situation? If so, how about keeping the last â€œgoodâ€ set of axes (basis vectors) and when you detect one of these bad cases, use the saved coordinate system, adjusting the origin as necessary to the midpoint of the shared edge common to the bad triangle and the next one?	3	Confirmation
2734573	5643697	Doesn't $|X|\le1$ mean that the cardinality of $X$ is less than or equal to 1?	3	Confirmation
1157824	2360720	I assume that $x>0$, as is the quantity on the right?	3	Confirmation
3593827	7388510	In your [motivating question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3593506/how-to-write-a-mixed-integer-program-for-a-streak), $(c,d,e)=(x,1,-1)$, right?	3	Confirmation
4350460	9079881	Do you mean that, in your opinion, the definition of ordering in the sense of $<$ does not need to replace the "connex" condition? Is this your question?	3	Confirmation
2722481	5620267	It appears that you want to arrange the rectangles so that the midpoint of a chosen side of each touches the circle and the rectangles are packed as tightly as possible. Is that about right?	3	Confirmation
2604608	5378379	First: if you have $f(x)=2a+3b$ you can say just $f(x)=k$. Second: do you mean by the Epsilon-Delta definition? Or by $\lim_{h\to0}|f(x)-f(x+h)|=0$? Or maybe other definition?	3	Confirmation
328171	709367	So we delete $\frac{7}{8}$ of the elements yet we copy a quarter over?  How does that work?  Also you define two things as the 'current' number of elements.  Do you mean $n$ is how many elements you start with?	3	Confirmation
3215548	6616192	are you asking what kind of mathematical object $\nabla g$ is? Or are you also interested in what this quantity means?	3	Confirmation
1723255	3518242	"if I have $2$ questions correct in a row, the following questions will give me an additional point if I am correct" -- do I understand correctly that any correct answer preceded by at least two correct answers is worth $2$ points? So e.g. "wrong, right, right, right, right, right, wrong" would be worth $5+3=8$ points?	3	Confirmation
3748552	7709972	you put "$i_j$ ranges from $0$ to $r_j$" : is that an actual requirement ?	3	Confirmation
3685461	7576373	Am I correct in saying what you meant by the second question is "let $v^* \in \Bbb R$ ...."? I.e., $v^*$ is just a real number that will act as the target $v$ approaches in the limits?	3	Confirmation
1034874	2109353	so a loop would be a closed path without backtracking?	3	Confirmation
3302644	6794612	To confirm, are you trying to show $x \mapsto \langle x, y \rangle - H(x)$ obtains a unique maximum for any given $y$, where $H$ is strictly convex, homogeneous of degree $2$, and continuously twice-differentiable everywhere but $0$?	3	Confirmation
2720469	5616002	Do you want $f$ to be continuous?	3	Confirmation
946265	1949360	Are you sure the recurrence starts with $k=0$? That leads to $E(0) = 1+E(0)$.	3	Confirmation
1351742	2748276	What book is this? I'm guessing $k_{n+1}$ is the set of $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ matrices over the field $k$. The $n+1$ is the dimension of $A^1$ which is clearly one more than $A$.	3	Confirmation
3694877	7596966	Did you read somewhere that this is true? In a 1981 paper, "*Almost split sequences in subcategories*" Auslander and SmalÃ¸ raised this as a problem (with the extra condition that $\mathcal{T}$ should be closed under extensions), and proved it is some special cases. But I thought that the general case (even assuming "closed under extensions") was still not known.	3	Confirmation
1366366	2780376	It *is* the correct answer. What do you think is the correct answer, and why?	2	Confirmation
2292287	4715779	Is this a tenth power or does this symbolize that we are talking about a number $N$ with base-10 digits as specified?	2	Confirmation
1529048	3114070	you want to compute the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution?!	2	Confirmation
2058528	4225545	I suppose I'm left asking should they be equal? or why do you think they should be equal.	2	Confirmation
3742710	7696213	Is your convention that $v$ and $w$ are row vectors?	2	Confirmation
4355301	9092989	@Fractal20 As in, restriction(s) independent of the initial condition?	2	Confirmation
342569	737408	I take it that $T$ is supposed to be itself recursive?	2	Confirmation
255901	560737	If $m-k$ is odd then that inequality is equivalent to $$k \geq m - \log_2 \left[\sqrt{\pi} \binom{m}{n} \right].$$ Is this the kind of thing you're looking for?	2	Confirmation
2578563	5322448	Sorry, that doesn't work. I assume that there is an understood *summation* over $m$?	2	Confirmation
3347323	6890980	Oh, so $\int_S\frac{\sigma(x')}{\|x_0-x'\|}\,da'$ has the same value for all $x_0\in S$?	2	Confirmation
342519	737280	By graph, do you mean the graph of a function?	2	Confirmation
4299660	8954443	Is it a conjecture or do you know that it is true and you need a proof?	2	Confirmation
3210981	6606846	Are you sure that you have made no typo?	2	Confirmation
2637003	5447831	Are you sure you want $\Psi$ and not $\sqrt{\Psi}$? The latter is the distance with respect to the Frobenius norm.	2	Confirmation
1903783	3906663	It mentions that you use Python. Does this indicate that a numerical approximated is wanted?	2	Confirmation
3603490	7407203	'Clearly then $k = 1$, else $k(p_1-1)(p_2-1) > n-1$'. Is this true? We've assumed $p_1 \neq 2$,but couldn't $p_2 = 2$? Then we would have $k(p_1-1)(p_2-1) = k(p_1-1) \geq (kp_1p_2)/2$, which is acceptable for $k = 2$ for strict equality?	2	Confirmation
530900	1134217	So what you're asking is more or less how specific one needs to be in order to justify calling a result a full classification?	2	Confirmation
3413069	7019368	Are you assuming that $f$ is everywhere nonnegative?	2	Confirmation
2078357	4269458	Are you trying to prove this asymptotically or for all $n$? I think this may not be true for all $n$ and for all growth functions, but I believe that, for all growth functions, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n \ge N$, $m_H(2n) \le m_H(n)^2$.	2	Confirmation
3409976	7013766	Would I be correct in interpreting $\mathbb P(A \rightarrow B)$ is a probability distribution on the set of functions from $A\rightarrow B$ and $A\rightarrow \mathbb P(B)$ is the set of functions from $A$ to probability distributions on $B$? These sets are related in interesting ways that I could write an answer about, but I'm not sure that's what you mean.	2	Confirmation
1559200	3174762	I assume you've used $\log \det(X) = \text{tr} \log (X)$ in coming up with the first derivative and that hasn't helped?	1	Confirmation
1390121	2829922	@Eric I edited $\mathbb{R}^3$ insted of R3, is it ok?	1	Confirmation
4396267	9194323	Isomorphic as vector spaces? It does not seem that the $H$'s form a Lie algebra.	1	Confirmation
357748	768874	Do you need to know how may solutions are there, or you just need to write them down (probably via software)?	1	Confirmation
2563829	5291744	You want to integrate the function $y^2-x^4$ over the convex quadrilateral in the $xy$-plane having vertices at $(0,0),(3,0),(0,3),(1,1)$. Did I understand the problem correctly?	1	Confirmation
946623	1949728	Surely $A \cap B \in \sigma(A,B)$? (I presume by $\sigma(A,B)$ you mean the smallest sigma algebra containing $A$ and $B$).	1	Confirmation
1326023	2694211	You mean that this should hold for all $x$ in the ring, or just for some $x$?	1	Confirmation
1198873	2442574	Would you be interested in a proof of (2) and (3) which relied on using the derivative and the series for $\ln(1+t)$? [There is such a proof, a bit long to write, but I'm asking if use of the series for log is OK in a proof, since you say "looking for a solution based only on induction and basic facts about sequences."]	1	Confirmation
227556	507214	When you say "exact probability", are you after a numerical answer? That would vary, depending on the values of `M` and `N` surely?	1	Confirmation
3420538	7034924	Is the $=1$ constraint indexed by $w$ and $b$?	1	Confirmation
3700638	7609882	There are algorithms that provably halt with probability 1 using SLLN but cannot be proven to halt with any positive probability using WLLN.  Is that the type of application you're asking for?	1	Confirmation
1107034	2257288	You are asking about the integral $\int\sin(2\pi nt)\sin(2\pi mt)\mathrm dt$ but only in the case where $n=m$... Why not simply ask about the integral of $\int\sin^2(2\pi nt)\mathrm d t$, which is clearly the same thing in that case?!	1	Confirmation
4152041	8595874	I take it you mean $\forall A,B \text{ } \exists c$?	1	Confirmation
4378615	9151207	Do you assume that the sum of $\pm x_i$, which includes at least two different $x_i$ cannot be $0$ unless each group of $x_i$ sums to $0$?	1	Confirmation
3357444	6910120	Are $G$ and $H$ free $A$-modules? Are they projective?	1	Confirmation
774969	1608274	but no _modus tollens_ ($\phi \rightarrow \psi, \lnot\psi \vdash \lnot\phi$) of course?	1	Confirmation
3676325	7585572	If $f(u,v) \geq 0$ then $g(x)=0$ iff $z(x)=f(z(x),xz(x))=0$, right?	1	Confirmation

3416476	7026950	Is $P$ a projection matrix? I don't see why it should be idempotent.	1	Confirmation
1763932	3599738	Is $\emptyset$ excluded?  for $n=1$ I'd assume the answer was $2$, no?  But you get $1$.	1	Confirmation
1654261	3374623	Why does it seems that $f(x)\neq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+1)(x^n + x^{n+1})$? You conclude this by looking at the first term of the sum. In your answer that is $1+x$, in the given solution it is $1$, so it can't tbe the case that $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+1)(x^n + x^{n+1})$, right? Wrong, because it can very well be that the "sums" (i.e. the series) are equal even though the first term isn't. The same way $1+2+3=2+1+3$ even though $1\neq 2$.	0	Confirmation
2656544	5487055	Just to make sure: Did you state the problem correctly? Or do you mean this https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1453890/42969 ?	0	Confirmation

2761074	5694900	I suppose you mean $\int^x f(t)\,\mathrm dt$ rather than $\int f(x)\,\mathrm dx$? And yes, this condition does conclude that $f=g$, i.e. that the slope of the two functions given by $\int^x f(t)\,\mathrm dt$ and $\int^x g(t)\,\mathrm dt$ are the same.	0	Confirmation
2735541	5645604	Is it possible that they are asking for a multiplicative inverse that is specifically a Cauchy sequence? Because the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4... is definitely not Cauchy.	0	Confirmation
4315665	8993414	Do you mean that $E/E'$ is a torsion sheaf on a surface wwith $c_1(E/E')=0?	0	Confirmation
1466367	2986187	The second and last sets definitely don't span $\Bbb R^3$.  For the third, you'd have to tell me how you define $\Bbb R^3$.  Is it the set of all $3\times 1$ matrices?  Then no, it doesn't span.  Is it the $3$-dimensional vector space over the reals defined up to isomorphism?  Then yes, it does span.	0	Confirmation

2227375	4736951	Doesn't the non-trivial double cover of the one dimensional sphere factor through the "eight space", i.e., the union of two Spheres in a point?	3	Correction
2600387	5369362	Should your indicator function be ${\bf 1}_{\{|X_n| \geq t\}}$?	3	Correction
3903472	8050230	So you are interesting of the convergence of the *sequence* $a_k$, not the series ? Your title mentions the word series.	3	Correction
736204	1535919	Shouldn't it be $(15)(16)(24)(23)(27)$?  Permutations are conventionally composed from left to right, and it seems that by comparing the disjoint cycle representation to the product of transpositions representation, that this is where you've had difficulty.	3	Correction
3395059	6984349	Did you mean $p''(t)$ when you wrote $t''(p)$?	3	Correction
315522	683165	You have the correct formula. What prevents you from using it? You just have to set $u$ to be equal to the first vector, the one that generates $L$.	3	Correction
1422763	2898060	And where is the question? Putting it in the title is not the best way to ask. Anyway, the answer is negative no matter how one interprets the question.	3	Correction

4209547	8737928	Should it be $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$?	3	Correction
1693570	3458203	@Calculon Ah, I see, I missed this detail. However, the statement in my previous comment remains valid if you replace "$t \geq 0$" by "$t>0$". Regarding your claim: No, that's not correct. First of all, $t$ is fixed so why is there a "$\exists s,t$" at the right-hand side?(I guess that's a "different" $t$) ... and anyway, this looks still rather overcomplicated to me. Why do you need two sequences ....?	3	Correction

406035	869034	I don't think it is different.  Suppose $x \in \bar{Y}$. For any $\epsilon$ there must be a $U_n$ with $x \in U_n \subset B(x, \epsilon/3)$.  Then $$\operatorname{diam}(Y \cap U_n) \le \operatorname{diam}(U_n) \le \operatorname{diam}(B(x, \epsilon/3) \le 2\epsilon/3 < \epsilon$$ so we have $x \in A$.  Are you sure you've read and transcribed correctly?  You could post more context from the proof.	2	Correction
1096570	2234951	Do you mean $v=1-a\left(\frac{1}{730}\right)^\frac{5}{8}$?  The way you wrote it (with the negative sign inside the $\frac 18$ power) is imaginary.	2	Correction
1242217	2525394	Isn't it supposed to be $w_{r+1} = v - \frac{\langle v,w_1\rangle}{\langle w_1,w_1\rangle}w_1-\dots$?  Otherwise your $w_{r+1}$ is defined as a linear combination of $w_i$'s since each $\langle \bullet,\bullet\rangle$ is a scalar.	2	Correction

4023418	8311943	Hello @pyring, and welcome to math.SE! Currently the question seems to have a chunk missing, replaced by "*[...here I explain models MI and MII, and then I proceed to describe the aggregation rules...]*". As the question is largely about mathematical communication I feel this portion might be important, both because some of the 'interesting' stuff might happen there, and because some notation in the following section ($f_{x_0}$) has not been introduced elsewhere.

3983968	8220608	Could you point to some of the particular materials since context might matter? Generally though, if $\gamma$ is not an integer and one has $\gamma = n + a$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 <a < 1$ then $C^\gamma$ is the space of $n$-times differentiable functions whose $n$-th derivative is $a$-Holder continuous. In the case where $\gamma$ is an integer, it is common in the SPDE literature to set $C^\gamma$ to be the slightly larger space of $(\gamma-1)$-times differentiable functions whose $(\gamma - 1)$-th derivative is Lipschitz.	2	Incomplete

2605332	5379927	Can you find one minimal element?  Can you find a second?  You are correct that there are an infinite number of minimal elements.  A good way here is to describe the minimal elements and note that there are an infinite number meeting the description.	2	Incomplete
1807896	3693902	It would help if you give some context about your background in this subject.  For instance are you familiar with the concept of writing the matrix of a linear transformation in terms of a basis?  I really don't know what material you're comfortable with.	2	Incomplete

2369004	4881796	What does $A=1$ mean?  Do you have a segment of length $1$ in your field?  if so then (by a standard abuse of the method) you can just translate that segment over to your line.  Or do you mean to say that you have a segment of length $\sqrt 2 -1$ and need to construct a segment of length $1$?	2	Incomplete
356166	765686	Your problem statement is nearly incomprehensible to me.  What is $u$ and $x$?  maybe a little detail on what you did might help.	2	Incomplete
3425527	7044289	It might have been a mistake to set $V = \mathbb R^n$, because the abstract case might be easier (there are fewer wrong directions to move in). What is your definition of $A^*$? Is $A$ not a linear transformation rather than a matrix?	2	Incomplete
3075109	6340082	The point is that $x_0$ is a solution of ${\cal L}[x]={\cal L}[x_0]$, the linear equation is not homogeneous. // In the given equation there is a lower bound for the period, and the period depends on the level of the energy function that the solution lives in. The level set and thus the solution are determined by the period. Is that mentioned in the book?	2	Incomplete

306999	665528	Aha, you should have started with that link.. Also, wikipedia says a different definition for quasi-commutative semigroup (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_semigroup), but probably this is the same as in the paper.

364173	781862	To be honest, your question is not clear to me. Do you want to prove that the first fundamental form is positive definite in a coordinate-free manner? When I said "impossible" I meant that in the form as the problem is stated this is, probably, not expected. Of course, one can show this in an invariant way, but using a different notation...	2	Incomplete
3267863	6719841	Is it Limit[Cos[2] (2 x) 2 x - 3, x -> Infinity] or Limit[Cos[2 (2 x) 2 x - 3], x -> Infinity] or Limit[Cos[(2 x)]^2 (2 x) - 3, x -> Infinity] or something else? How is one supposed to interpret that function definition - does the book give any clues on that?	2	Incomplete

3917525	8079429	I think you need to start by explaining your full setup in an [edit] to your question. What are all of your definitions? Specifically, what is a projective curve for you? Without having a common framework of definitions, it's really hard to have a productive conversation.	2	Incomplete
2265384	4659047	What is "this" in "... to estimate this"? You say "Some people argue that the answer is just 10" - but what in fact is the *question*?	1	Incomplete

3103894	6396976	Can you explain what $+$ is here? Since you're summing a unit vector and a scalar. Note that this has no solutions even if I assume that $3 = 3(1,....,1)$, since then every component of the unit vector needs to be $-3/2$.	1	Incomplete

1138868	2324267	Is there some context to determine what these variables actually mean?  This problem is annoyingly ambiguous.  What does it mean to repair a server at rate $\delta$?  What does it mean to breakdown at rate $\gamma$ ?  Probability of breakdown per customer?  Amount of breakdowns per unit time?  This problem seems to be a guessing game.	1	Incomplete

3566998	7334728	your restrictions are a little unclear. no squares: That is, no two dominoes may be directly adjacent, ie, lying lined up with one another? If that's to be interpreted, then you may never have any configuration greater than 2x1? are we covering the table, or are partial covers allowed?	1	Incomplete

3581304	7363161	What do you know how to do? The standard way of calculating LCMs does not involve prime factorizations (as pointed out by Will Fagy, whose answer you have dismissed). If you have the prime factorizations, then the LCM is trivial to calculate. What are you really asking?	1	Incomplete
3655297	7511792	The rules are not clear.  Are you saying that no two balls can be next to each other or that the three balls can not be next to each other in a block?  That is, is $rgtbs$ a good ordering or not?	1	Incomplete

3463401	7119860	I don;t understand the picture ... there seem to be corridors between some of the rooms (e.g. between 4 and 5) ... so the lack of a corridor seems to suggest that you can't move between them?  But then many rooms are isolated!  And if all rooms are supposed to have doors, so you can move between the 'islands', then what prevents the rector to just go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11? Also, do the symbols in the rooms mean anything relevant?	1	Incomplete

All you said in your question is correct, except that "What I didnâ€™t get is how is sin theta = FE/OE"  - where does this "sin theta = FE/OE" come from?  If you can clarify this, that would be helpful.	0	Incomplete

2678410	5531943	It is unclear to me what is your question. For instance, what does $e^x$ represents geometrically when $x$ is a real number? Could you answer this question? To me, this is a meaningless question unless you specify what geometric would mean here. One can talk about 1-parameter subgroups and some would regard thus as algebra, some as geometry ...	0	Incomplete

2568600	5302361	The sets $B$ and $\coprod_{p \in M} \pi^{-1}(p)$ are *the same set*. So there are not two topologies, there is only one topology on that one set. Also, usually one doesn't bother with $B / \sim$ since, as you point out, it corresponds bijectively with $M$ itself. I can try to write an answer, but it would greatly help to know how much topology you know? Do you know the definition of a topology? The definition of a basis of a topology?

And, of course, you have to argue that you can choose these $U_i$ to cover $\Bbb R^2$.
